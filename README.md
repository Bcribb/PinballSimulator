# Pinball simulator

This is an in development attempt to create a simple, 3D, networked ball simulation within Roblox.

Balls are created on the client side and simulated on the server. The location of balls is replicated to all clients simulatenously.

Currently supports bouncing and rolling balls.

```

Next, open `Dop.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:
