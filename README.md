# Pinball simulator

This is an in development attempt to create a simple, 3D, networked ball simulation within Roblox. I'm attempting this with use of the Matter entity component system (ECS) for Roblox [Matter](https://eryn.io/matter/)

Balls are created on the client side and simulated on the server. The location of balls is replicated to all clients simulatenously.

Currently supports bouncing and rolling balls.

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.3.0.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Dop.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Dop.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
